I have realized through careful reflection that I was not as present and attentive in our relationship as you deserve. Reflecting on the past, I see times when you needed me, and I was not there for you emotionally or physically. It pains me to think about those moments and the ways I may have made you feel alone or neglected. You deserve someone who shows up fully for you, and I am committed to being that person. I sincerely apologize for my inattention and ask for your forgiveness. Let me prove how much you truly mean to me.">
