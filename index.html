      I have realized through careful reflection that I was not as present and attentive in our relationship as you deserve. 
      I have realized that words I have said have hurt you. There were no justifiable reasons for my hurtful actions in the past.  
      It pains me to think about those moments and the ways I made you feel alone or neglected. You deserve someone who shows up fully for you, and I am committed to being that person. 
      I sincerely apologize for my inattention and ask for your forgiveness. Let me prove how much you truly mean to me.">
